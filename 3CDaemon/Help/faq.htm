<p><em><strong>Is it Y2K compliant?</strong></em></p>

<p><small>The original 3CServer (on which 3CDaemon is based) was written as a piece of *freeware* by myself. It is not
an &quot;officially&quot; supported 3Com product - It has no 3C Number, does not appear on
any product list. I just saw a need and wrote the software to fill it. I am an employee of
3Com, but wrote the server in my spare time.</small></p>

<p><small>Then, 3Com Network Management Division (NMD) saw the server, and liked it.
Seeing an opportunity for wider distribution of the program, I gave NMD the code. They
produced a slightly modified version (different icons, other cosmetics, the core code
remains the same) based on 3CServer 1.1.007. This became part of the NetBuilder II Remote
Upgrade Utilities Version 11.0. (RUU). 3CServer will also be part of Transcend NT Version
1.1.</small></p>

<p><em><strong>So, is 3CServer/3CDaemon Y2K compliant?</strong></em></p>

<p><small>All of the functions which use a date including a year, use the Microsoft
function CTime, which is accurate up to the year 2038. I have done some testing. What I
did was go through the code and looked for every instance where I used a date with
includes a year designation. In every case, dates which are post-2000 were rendered
correctly. So, as far as I can determine, 3CServer is Y2K compliant. However, this is me
speaking as an individual (and the developer of the freeware code), not as a
representative of 3Com. </small></p>

<p><small>3CServer will be included as part of the Transcend NT 1.1 Y2K compliance tests.</small></p>

<p><small>So, even though 3CDaemon already passed all my tests for Y2K compliance, it is
usually considered bad practice for the person who developed the code to also test and
certify it. If you wish a version that has been independantly tested, consider Transcend
NT 1.1.</small></p>

<p><small>In either case, 3CDaemon never does any computations where it compares one date
against another. Thus, it's difficult to imagine what Y2K issues it could have...</small></p>

<p><em><strong>Differences from Berkeley TFTP Daemon</strong></em><small><br>
<br>
3CDaemon is designed to be as user-friendly as possible. While the Berkeley Tftp daemon
concentrates on security, 3CDaemon concentrates on ease of use. The main differences are: </small>

<ul>
  <li><small>3CDaemon does not require that the destination file already exist on the server
    before allowing a transfer to occur.</small></li>
  <li><small>3CDaemon will allow incoming files to overwrite files which already exist on the
    server (This is a user-selectable option.)</small></li>
  <li><small>3CDaemon will allow the creation of directories, if the client sends a directory
    name with the file request. ( This is a user-selectable option.)</small></li>
  <li><small>Files can also be retrieved from subdirectories of the Upload/Download directory</small></li>
  <li><small>3CDaemon is more verbose when errors occur. The TFTP specification (RFC 1350)
    defines only 8 error messages which can be transmitted back to the client when a problem
    occurs. However, ERROR 0 is UNDEFINED ERROR CODE, and instructs the user to SEE ERROR
    MESSAGE (IF ANY). 3CDaemon takes advantage of this, and returns ERROR 0 for most problems,
    with a verbose description of what went wrong.</small></li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Limitations:</strong></em></p>

<p><small>The following FTP commands are not implemented, just because they didn&#146;t
seem applicable: ACCT, SMNT, STOU, ALLO, SITE</small></p>

<p><small>In addition, some other commands are implemented but with some limitations:</small></p>

<p><small>LIST and NLST do not support switches. Any switches are parsed off the command
line, and a standard file listing is returned.</small></p>

<p><small>The TYPE command will accept ASCII or BINARY. EBCDIC is not supported.<br>
The MODE command only supports type &#147;Stream&#148;<br>
The STRU command only supports type &#147;File&#148;</small></p>

<p><small>The Syslog server, unlike some syslogd implementations, does not apply a host
name to received messages. Messages are always logged as dotted decimal IP addresses. This
would be easy enough to implement, but I am concerned about the latency problems in doing
a host lookup for every message (especially if the messages are coming fast and furious!)</small></p>
