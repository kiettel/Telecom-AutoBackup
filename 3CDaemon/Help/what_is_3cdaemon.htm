<title>What is 3CDaemon?</title>

<p><em><strong>Why another TFTP Server? Doesn't 3Com already supply one?</strong></em></p>

<p>In the beginning, there was 3CTftpd, which was a small TFTP Server program I wrote so
that 3Com customers could upgrade their 3Com equipment.</p>

<p>3CTftpd begat 3CServer, which was a more full-featured TFTP and FTP server I wrote.
This eventually became part of 3Com's Transcend Network Management product.</p>

<p>However, it soon became apparent that our customers were using 3CServer for a lot of
other things, in addition to upgrading their 3Com boxes. I was getting a number of
enhancement requests. In order to accommodate these requests, I took another look at the
code, and tried to implement as many as I could.</p>

<p>There was a problem, though. 3CServer was now part of a different product. I spoke with
our Network Management folks, and we agreed that we didn't want the two programs getting
in each other's way. Therefore, I decided to rename my newest incarnation to 3CDaemon.</p>

<p><em><strong>I'm confused! Which one should I use?</strong></em></p>

<p>It's really a matter of personal choice. If 3CServer fulfills your needs, then by all
means, continue using it. If you want or need some of the extra functionality provided by
3CDaemon, then use it instead. Either one will work for upgrading 3Com products, since
they are adapted from the same code base. Since both are freeware, I don't make a penny
off of them either way :)</p>

<p><em><strong>So, what's new in this 3CDaemon thing?</strong></em> 

<ul>
  <li>New interface. Lot more extensible, so that I can add sub-programs more easily.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>TFTP Server:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for RFC 1782, 1783 and 1784. Block size, timeout and transfer-size negotiation. </li>
    <li>Faster. See speed comparison chart below. </li>
    <li>Prints IP address(es) on which it is listening. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>FTP Server:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Supports PASSIVE transfer.</li>
    <li>Supports Netscape/IE4 browsing</li>
    <li>Supports 32 char passwords.</li>
    <li>Passwords are MD5 hashed. This should provide adequate password security, yet at the
      same time still be exportable.</li>
    <li>Prints IP address(es) on which it is listening.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Syslog Server:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Added Syslog functionality. </li>
    <li>Logs all syslog messages received.</li>
    <li>Allows filtering/restriction of syslog messages by IP Address.</li>
    <li>Allows logging into via message priority, message facility or IP address.</li>
    <li>Allows viewing of the log files while active, plus copy to clipboard or print</li>
    <li>Produces standard ASCII text files, suitable for including in emails or faxing.</li>
    <li>Prints IP address(es) on which it is listening.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>TFTP Client:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for RFC 1782, 1783 and 1784. Block size, timeout and transfer-size negotiation.</li>
    <li>Stores addresses of frequently accessed hosts</li>
    <li>Supports multiple file transfer, or directory transfer</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li>Lots and lots of other little fixes and enhancements. Play with it. I'll be adding more
    as time goes by.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Totally Unscientific Speed comparison:</p>

<p>(i.e. These are numbers I got transferring the same file between two PCs on the same
hub. Your mileage will vary...)</p>
