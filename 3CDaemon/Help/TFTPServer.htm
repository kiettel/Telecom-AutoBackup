<p>The TFTP Server in 3CDaemon offers the following features: 

<ul>
  <li>RFC 1350 compliant TFTP Services</li>
  <li>Support for ASCII and Binary transfers</li>
  <li>RFC 1782 - TFTP Option extension</li>
  <li>RFC 1783 - BlockSize Negotiation</li>
  <li>RFC 1784 - Timeout Interval and Transfer Size negotiation</li>
  <li>User configurable timeouts and retries</li>
  <li>Automatic directory creation (configurable)</li>
  <li>Logging and debugging</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RFC 1782, 1783 and 1784 are automatically implemented in the server,
and require no user configuration. If the client asks for the option, and the server can
provide it, it will be provided.</p>

<p>Here is the configuration screen, and what each value means:</p>

<table border="2" width="100%" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td width="47%" valign="top"><small>Create directory names in incoming file requests?</small></td>
    <td width="53%"><small>If set, this will allow requests from TFTP clients which contain
    embedded directory names, to have those directories automatically created. For example,
    your Upload Directory is set as C:\TEMP\. The Client requests to send the file
    &quot;/foobar/foobar.bin&quot;. The file which will be created is
    C:\TEMP\foobar\foobar.bin, <em>even if c:\temp\foobar\ does not exist</em>. It will be
    created.</small></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="47%" valign="top"><small>Allow overwrite of existing files?</small></td>
    <td width="53%"><small>If a client does a Write Request, and the file already exists on
    the server, will it be overwritten? If this option is checked, the file is allowed to be
    overwritten. If it is not checked, the client will get an &quot;Access Denied&quot;
    message. If the file exists, but is marked &quot;read-only&quot; on the server, <em>even
    if this option is checked</em>, the client will get an &quot;Error accessing file&quot;
    message, and the file will not be overwritten.</small></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="47%" valign="top"><small>Upload/Download directory:</small></td>
    <td width="53%"><small>This is the directory from which the TFTP Server will serve files.
    Either type in a directory name, or press the &quot;...&quot; button and pick a directory
    from the pop-up list.</small></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="47%" valign="top"><small>Per-Packet Timeout in seconds:</small></td>
    <td width="53%"><small>This will determine how long the TFTP Server will wait for an
    acknowledgement of a packet before it retransmits the packet. In general, the default of 5
    should be sufficient. You may want to put it higher if you have slow links, or a slow TFTP
    Client. If the client does RFC 1784 TimeOut negotiation, the timeout proposed by the
    client will be accepted, and will override this value.</small></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="47%" valign="top"><small>Maximum Retries:</small></td>
    <td width="53%"><small>The number of times that an unacknowledged packet will be
    retransmitted before the TFTP Server considers the transfer as &quot;failed&quot;. The
    default value of 10 should be sufficient for most applications.</small></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="47%" valign="top"><small>Interframe Transmission Gap:</small></td>
    <td width="53%"><small>Causes an X millisecond gap to be inserted between frames
    transmitted by the server. Shouldn't ever really be required; Just something I was fooling
    around with. Leave this set to 0 (default). Trust me....</small></td>
