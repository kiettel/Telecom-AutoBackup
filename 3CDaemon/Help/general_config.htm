    list or recent sessions. If these lists are never cleared, or if you have an especially
    busy server, this can consume a lot of memory. By selection this option, each list will
    contain a maximum of XXX entries. As new entries come in, the oldest entries on the list
    are dropped. (If you have enabled logging, the log files will still contain those entries,
    so you are not really missing anything.)</small></td>
