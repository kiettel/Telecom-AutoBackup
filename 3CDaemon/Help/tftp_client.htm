<p>The TFTP Client in 3CDaemon offers the following features: 

<ul>
  <li>Support for RFC 1782, 1783 and 1784. Block size, timeout and transfer-size negotiation.</li>
  <li>Stores addresses of frequently accessed hosts</li>
  <li>Supports multiple file transfer, or directory transfer</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the user interface screen for the TFTP Client. The various options are
described below:</p>

    <td width="60%"><small>Type in the IP address of the TFTP server with which you wish to
    exchange files. If you prefer, the TFTP client keeps track of servers it has spoken to in
    the past. This list can be accessed by selecting the pull-down for this field.</small></td>

    <td width="60%"><small>This is the file name that will be sent to the remote TFTP server
    in the read/write request. Probably a good idea to use unix-style syntax here (i.e, use
    &quot;/&quot;, instead of &quot;\&quot;).</small></td>

    <td width="40%" valign="top"><small>Local File Name</small></td>
    <td width="60%"><small>This is the name of the file as it will exist on the local file
    system (i.e. your PC). You may use the &quot;...&quot; button to browse for a file, if you
    wish.</small></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="40%" valign="top"><small>RFC 1783 Block Size Negotiation</small></td>
    <td width="60%"><small>If checked, indicates that you want to negotiate the blocksize with
    the remote server.</small><p><small> Note that the server may not support negotiation, in

  <tr>
    <td width="40%" valign="top"><small>Blocksize</small></td>
    <td width="60%"><small>Enter the size (in bytes) of the blocksize you wish to use.
    Although 3CDaemon supports block sizes up to 32000 bytes, there may not always be enough
    available memory to honor such a request. Besides, there is a law of diminishing returns
    once the block size exceeds a certain size. (i.e. you gain no speed advantage with a 20K
    block size over a 10K block size). Values between 512-10240 bytes seem to work well</small></td>

    <td width="40%" valign="top"><small>RFC 1784 Timeout Negotiation</small></td>
    <td width="60%"><small>If checked, indicates that you want to negotiate the per-packet
    timeout with the remote server.</small><p><small> Note that the server may not support
    negotiation, in which case, the default is to use whatever is configured as per-packet
    timeout in the <a href="TFTPServer.htm">TFTP Server.</a></small></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="40%" valign="top"><small>Seconds</small></td>
    <td width="60%"><small>How many seconds before a packet is considered timed-out? Although
    acceptable values range from 1 to 255 seconds (because the RFC says so....), it doesn't
    make much sense to set this value higher than 25. If the host hasn't responded in 25
    seconds, odds are he is not going to respond at all.</small></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="40%" valign="top"><small>RFC 1784 Transfer Size Negotiation</small></td>
    <td width="60%"><small>If checked, indicates that you want to negotiate the TransferSize
    with the remote server. Inherantly, TFTP does not have a facility to learn the size of
    remote files. This option adds that ability. Knowing the size of the file in advance
    allows you to draw &quot;pretty progress bars&quot;. </small><p><small>Note that the
    server may not support negotiation, in which case, the file is still transferred, but you
    don't get a progress bar.</small></td>

    <td width="60%"><small>If all your parameters have been entered correctly, your file will
    be transferred when you click this button. If the file fails to transfer, look at the
    &quot;Progress:&quot; field to discover what went wrong.</small></td>

    <td width="40%" valign="top"><small>STOP button</small></td>
    <td width="60%"><small>Stops a transfer in progress. If you are transferring multiple
    files, or a whole directory, it will prompt you to stop either the current transfer, or
    all pending transfers. If you are not currently transferring a file, clicking this button
    does nothing.</small></td>
